##Chapter I - Downward Spiral
<!--
NOTES

This will be the part where the first sets of dreams are described and the living situation and lifestyle are elaborated on and building up the sense of the differentiating details of the story and dropping a few clues to the path that it will be taking and where it will first introduce some of the maleficent beings living in the world.

**August 29th - 3:18AM EST** Tonight is another night I can't sleep. I stay up with a mixed concoction[^a] of painkillers, weed, and cigarettes. Typically this isn't a problem, it's usually something I intend on doing. However a few weeks ago after finishing up some ``work`` I[^b] dosed off sitting at my desk and had very strange dream. The dream was very detailed it involved walking away from a vehicle that seemingly had either been shut off for awhile or broke down. Walking down a dirt path that looked as though it hadn't been used in a good amount of time and was just sort of carved out of the forrest or it was path designed to encourage me to proceed. Walking down the path feeling a slow vibration in the place of any wind or movement. Everything with no saturation at all. Leaves, trees and dirt see mingling stuck on pause in a virtual version of a picture as if another plane of existence had been generated from a still photograph. Along the path you could see rocks and an incline on the right and a slow but continuous decline on the left. 

After I awoke[^music 1] and feeling very disjointed coming to and hearing the faint music I had had playing in the background starting to come through the haze.

##Chapter II - Lost
<!--
NOTES

After the first section introduces the first of a many dreams this will elaborate on the tangible world in which he feels disconnected with and how he operates with basic tasks. Detailing uncomfortable menial tasks: having a emotional collapse while alone in the laundry room.

Driving out at night to clear the head. Easy to get lost since it has been forever that I have gone outside of the small neck of the woods where I lay my head[^music 2]. Everyone I encounter feels distant and merely a cutout of a person. Their speech seeming completely scripted and expected. I've driven for long enough to where I don't recognize the area i'm in and feel a wave of concern wash over followed by a thought of freedom. The ties to old thoughts, actions and memories finally broken and with that a sense of achievement. The road winds past some farms and is narrow with  only rocks and trees along the sides with the occasional guard rail to give you a sense of security as I am easily driving 60 miles an hour. The windows down and cigarette in hand flicking how ashes out feeling the gust of cold breeze blow in with each sweeping turn. Inches away from catastrophe and mishap.
